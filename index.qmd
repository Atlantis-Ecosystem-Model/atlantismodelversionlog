The Atlantis modeling framework is a simulation modeling approach developed by Dr. Beth Fulton at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) . Atlantis integrates physical, chemical, ecological, and anthropogenic processes in a three-dimensional, spatially explicit domain. This framework has been applied to evaluate management scenarios and investigate the effects of climate change in over 30 ecosystems worldwide. 
In Atlantis, ecosystem dynamics are represented by spatially explicit submodels that simulate oceanographic processes, biogeochemical factors driving primary production, and food web relations among flora and fauna. The model represents species of ecological and conservation concern and key exploited species at the level of detail necessary to evaluate the direct effects of fishing, and it represents other anthropogenic and climate impacts on the ecosystem as a whole.

```R
mkdir mynewbranch
cd mynewbranch
git init
git checkout -b mynewbranch
git remote add mynewbranch https://github.com/Atlantis-Ecosystem-Model/atlantismodelversionlog.git
```


2. Open the file `_quarto.yml` and add your comments under the corresponding *.qmd file for the version you are running.
You can also create a new page for a new version by making a copy of the file content/v_template.qmd and add its name under href in the `_quarto.yml` file.

```R

style: "docked"
    search: true
    collapse-level: 1
    contents:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: content/v6690.qmd
        text: v6690
```

2. Push your branch to the repository


```R
git add -A
git commit -m "-Added description of version 6690"
git push https://<user>:<PAT>/Atlantis-Ecosystem-Model/atlantismodelversionlog.git mynewbranch
```
